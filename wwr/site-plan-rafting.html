    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This webpage has the goal of helping individuals and families find the best weekend activity option, providing them an easy way to access to affordable rafting plans to have fun not only on summer, but the whole year. </p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience for this rafting webpage will be made of families, meaning that it has a wide age-range audience.  
        It will most likely be used by adults who look for vacation activities for the whole  
        family. However, the webpage should be clean and easily readable for everyone, since we want everyone, regardless of the age, 
        to be able to understand how to make reservations and look at all the company offers easily.  
        This audience in particular makes absolutely necessary that, in order to convince them to hire our  
        company instead than other, the website should be easy to use, because otherwise they will look for another one with an  
        easier webpage format to satisfy their necessities faster.</p>
